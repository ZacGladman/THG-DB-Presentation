## Pros and Cons

### Pros:

- good for very large datasets (petabyte-sized) (maybe a waste if they're not that big)
- good at big join operations
- uses familiar SQL syntax
- super-fast SQL queries using the processing power of Googleâ€™s infrastructure
- can process trillions of rows per second
- built-in machine learning features

### Cons:

- dependent on the Google Cloud Platform; need to be comfortable using it.
- potentially steep learning-curve in terms of data warehousing.
- might not be easy to integrate with non-GCP tools.
